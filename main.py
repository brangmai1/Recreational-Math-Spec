************ PERFECT NUMBERS ************

Definition #1:
A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its divisors except itself.

Definition #2:
A perfect number is a positive integer that is half the sum of all its divisors including itself.

Some perfect numbers: 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328

Unsolved perfect numbers:
1. Are there infinitely many perfect number?
2. Is there an odd perfect numbers?
